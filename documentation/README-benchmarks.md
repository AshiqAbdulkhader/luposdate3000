## Benchmarks

The benchmarks are updated soon ...

The script

```bash
./exec-benchmark-luposdate3000-internal.sh
```

Runs the sp2b and bsbm benchmarks and puts the results into the folder "benchmark_results".
Alternatively the script

```bash
./exec-benchmark-luposdate3000-internal-paper.sh
```

May also be used, which executed different benchmarks.
You may want to change the targetfolder to something else to get a usefull history.
It is unlikely that your hardware matches the one used to create the current benchmark values.
The current git revision is part of the benchmark-result-filename, to be able to exactly compare which code-changes changes the performance.
