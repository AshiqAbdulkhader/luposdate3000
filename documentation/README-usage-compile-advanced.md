## Usage / Compile (advanced)

To compile everything the first time you need to setup the buildfiles first.
Here you can specify many options like ("target, inlineMode, releaseMode, compiler, ...").

```bash
./launcher.main.kts --setupCommandline
```

afterwards you can compile it using gradle.

```bash
./gradlew build
```
